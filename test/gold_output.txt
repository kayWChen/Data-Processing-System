 surely you have heard about this man that became known when he offered 10,000 dollars to anyone who could prove his mother’s name was not “Madam.” His response to this challenge is now a meme. But how much do you know about Elon Musk?
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. He grew up with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in the suburbs of Pretoria in South Africa, although her biography as well describes that he lived in Canada for several years between ages eight and ten.
Elon Musk was born to Maye (née Haldeman) and Errol Musk, who is a South African electrical engineer, pilot and sailor. His father had a troubled childhood of moving across southern Africa with his family due to the apartheid regime. He has said that he grew up “underground” as his father was forced to move around frequently in order to avoid the law enforcement agents looking for him during those years.
When Elon Musk was 17 years old, both of his parents moved from Pretoria to Canada"

 Yes, it is. The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France on 9 avda Emile Goudeau. It was built by Gustave Eiffel and his team of engineers as an entry into the World Fair that was held in Paris in 1889.
The tower stands at 302m high (1,050 ft), which is approximately three times higher than any other structure from the nineteenth century or before that period, according to Guinness World Records. The Eiffel Tower was completed in May of 1889 and it continues today as an attraction for tourists visiting Paris with over 7 million visitors each year!
Is the Eiffel Tower located in France?
The answer is no because they don’t have any other country called “France”. It may be a French company or a person from another country, but that doesn’t mean it belongs to them.
It would be like saying that your house is located in Mexico and the neighbors are Mexican people who live there with their families, but they aren’t Mexicans by blood nor culture—they just happen to live on Mexican soil for whatever reason (job opportunity?"

 everybody knows that wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, but i dont know whether it is a non profit organisation or not. I am asking this question because in my country, there are some laws ( like sales tax for export) which are applicable only to registered business/ organisations and not to individuals.
In order to avoid the payment of such taxes, one has to register his company as a non-profit orgaisation in front of government authorities. I want to know whether wikipedia is an organization or just a website.
The Wikimedia Foundation (the organisation behind Wikipedia) does receive funding from donations and grants, but it's not registered as a non-profit organization with any particular country.
It is a US 501(c)(3) public charity. This means that donors can deduct contributions to the Wikimedia Foundation under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code; Wikipedia can participate in fundraising activities with the Wikimedia Foundation without losing its tax-exempt status, and the Wikimedia Foundation can receive grants from other organizations.

question-011	R" Berlin! So when my cousin told me she was moving there for three weeks from January through February, I knew that I had to get on a plane and see this wonderful city. obviously we went to all the touristy spots, but here are some tips on what you should do while in berlin.
Berlin is very spread out so it’s best to walk everywhere! The subway system is also pretty easy to use, but I would recommend walking if possible.
The Berlin Wall Memorial is a must see. It’s free and beautiful and emotional. You can read about the history of the wall and you can see what the wall looked like before it was torn down.
The Brandenburg Gate is another must see. It’s a very iconic landmark for berlin as well as Germany. The gate was built in 1791 and has been used as an important site in political events. In the center of the gate, you can see the chariot that was used to carry Napoleon into Berlin.
The Reichstag is another must see. It’s a beautiful building with a lot of history behind it. You have to book your tour online beforehand and there are only 100 people allowed on"

i know that chinese is a secondary langauge there...but what about english? i've heard that they speak English too (although my parents tried learning basic hiragana and katakana, and failed miserably)...how big a problem can speaking Chinese in japanese be when Japanese children go to schools where they are taught Chinese as well as Japanese?
i'm not sure if it would really affect their future.
The official language of Japan is Japanese. The second language for the Japanese is English, but there are also other languages that are spoken by many people such as Chinese and Korean. But don't worry about learning Chinese or Korean, since they will help you more on getting your point across if it involves dealing with a foreigner.
Its an issue I hear of frequently at school; kids get confused because their textbooks have Chinese characters in them, but they also speak English in the classroom as well as Japanese (with a lot of assistance for people new to Japan).

If you are a student of history or an American, I would urge you to get a copy of “The Presidential Elections”, by Donald Tuskaloos, a brilliant accountant, business man, and amateur historian. It’s a fascinating book that will change the way you look at our country’s governmental institutions, it is written in simple terms with amusing commentary as the author attempts to convince the reader of his conclusions.
I would also like to mention another book by Mr. Tuskaloos entitled “A history of presidential elections” that has some fascinating details on all the candidates and their backgrounds, and I believe this book might actually give one more ammunition against a potential future candidate. This is a very well written book that should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand how our government works!
